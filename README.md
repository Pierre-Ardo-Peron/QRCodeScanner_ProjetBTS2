# QRCodeScanner_ProjetBTS2
My first python project for a final school project, It's scan your information on a QR code and send it to your data base. It has really interesting to learn python and make this. 
I use MySQL for my data base, PyCharm for coding in python and the project work fully on a raspberry pi (I used a raspberry pi 4 Model B 4GB ram for this project).
Learn a bit of french in that code:

Nom = Last Name,
Prenom = First Name,
Telephone = Phone,
date entr√©e = Date of the insert in the data base.
